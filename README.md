## A very simple AutoHotKey script for switching workspaces using key/mous combos on Windows 10

### To Run
Download [workspaces.exe](https://github.com/matticoli/workspaces/raw/master/workspaces.exe) and double-click to run.

### To Run Automatically at Startup
Open `%appdata%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup` in Windows Explorer and copy the workspaces.exe file in. To stop it from running automatically at startup, simply remove the program from this folder.

### Controls
- Holding caps lock, use the left/right arrow keys or the mouse wheel to cycle between workspaces
- Holding caps lock, press the middle mouse button or up arrow key to open Task View
- If you do not have any programs that conflict, holding caps lock and using the left/right mouse buttons will also work for switching workspaces. This is nice for certain laptop trackpads.
